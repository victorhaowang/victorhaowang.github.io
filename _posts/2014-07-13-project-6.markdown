description: BCA Makerspace is a Wednesday Club that is run during the last hour of Wednesday's every week. In the this, students have access to the entire BCA Makerspace and are allowed to complete projects that they desire to. During my time in that club, I learned how to use the laser cutter and worked on my 3lb Battlebot.
