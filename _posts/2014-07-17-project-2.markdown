description: Coming into BCA as a freshmen, I had no idea what clubs to join. My first club was BCA Chinacare and at the time I really didn't know what to expect out of the club. After a tremondous amount of hard work and dedication, I was promoted to the position of Vice-President during my Junior Year. It wasn'y until my senior year that I finally earned the coveted position of President. The mission of the China Care Foundation is to give special needs Chinese orphans the opportunity for a better life and to empower youth through direct humanitarian service. By providing extensive medical, social and educational programs devoted to children, China Care makes a lasting contribution to our shared future.
