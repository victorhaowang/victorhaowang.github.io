description: The purpose of the JSA is to help high school students acquire leadership skills and the knowledge necessary to be effective debaters and civic participants. JSA is the largest completely student-run organization in the United States with over 10,000 members. It was because of my experience in JSA that I developed the necessary presentation and public speaking skills that I now have today.
